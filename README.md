# Lab 13 - Implement a cipher

ui.py - Contains code to run the cipher
example.py - An example cipher.
cipher01.py - This is where you should implement your cipher
cipher02.py - This is where you should implement your cipher
cipher03.py - This is where you should implement your cipher
cipher04.py - This is where you should implement your cipher
cipher05.py - This is where you should implement your cipher
cipher06.py - This is where you should implement your cipher
cipher07.py - This is where you should implement your cipher


## Getting Started

1. Run the program with the example cipher to see how it works:

`python ui.py`

2. Implement your cipher in one of the cipher files, cipher01.py 
through cipher07.py
